No,"He had the Tdap and meningococcal in his LA and HPV in his RA. His right arm did fine. By evening, his left bicep was swollen and red around the injection site. By the next morning, it was even larger and he had fluid building under his armpit. It continued to worsen throughout the day and by the evening the red portion covered all of his bicep and below and the swelling underneath the arm felt like a fluid filled balloon and almost made his armpit indistinguishable. I finally called our family physician on his cell that evening (he is a friend) and told him what was going on.  I was already icing it regularly and giving him ibuprofen.  He said that was really all I could do. I asked him if I should let the Health Department know the next day and he said that I could, but that they probably wouldn't do anything about it. My concern was for the next time he has to have this vaccine (in 10 years) - I wanted the reaction documented because I won't be with him when he receives it as an adult.  On 1/2/14, I took him to the HD and let someone look at it - the injection site also looked sunken by then (similar to old small-pox types spots).  She said this is ""normal"" and ""occurs 50% of the time"" with Tdap and that it is often bad in teens and adults.  I knew this wasn't entirely true, because his 2 older brothers didn't have this reaction.  Also, the hand-out did not have underarm swelling as an adverse effect or any reaction being 50% likely. She dismissed it as no big deal, but did say that his reaction was maybe a little worse than most.  I will never allow 2 injections to be given in the same extremity again.  Also, if this is common, someone should tell the parent to expect this reaction and definitely start icing and ibuprofen ahead of time.  Either he had an atypical reaction and someone should have documented it - neither Dr. or other person at the Health Department made any notes of his reaction - or the paperwork needs to be redone to make a parent aware that this is normal and they should go ahead and start icing and ibuprofen as soon as they get home.  I do have pictures of what his arm looked like on 1/1/13.  Today (1/4/13) the swelling has gone down a lot, but it isn't entirely gone. After looking at the next page, just to be clear: Left arm: Tdap & Meningoccal Right arm:  HPV (I have no way of knowing the manufacturers since they didn't even take my concern seriously.

Yes,"Initial report was received from the scientific literature on 28 December 2013. An 83-year-old female was admitted with 2 days of altered mental status, weakness and fever. She had past medical history of hypertension, ischemic stroke and diabetes. She received inactivated influenza vaccine five days ago. On exam, she was obtunded, febrile with bilateral extensor plantar response and brisk reflexes. Computed tomogram of the head was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed protein of 136 gm/dL, glucose of 108 gm/dL with lymphocytic pleocytosis (44 cells/microliter). Broad spectrum antibiotics were started for presumed infectious meningoencephalitis. Her mental status declined further and she required mechanical ventilation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine showed diffuse white matter lesions involving periventricular white matter, thalamus, midbrain, dorsal brainstem, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. CSF bacterial and fungal cultures, PCR for HSV, VZV, HHV-6, enterovirus, JC and BK viruses; anti-NMDA receptor antibody and flow cytometry for lymphoma were all negative. Serum studies for viral encephalitis, HIV and Quantiferon-TB were also negative. After exclusion of infectious and non-infectious causes, we made the diagnosis of post-vaccination ADEM based on the neurologic picture and MRI findings of extensive white matter changes along with recent influenza vaccination. DISCUSSION: ADEM is a rare inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with an incidence of 0.4/100.000. Infection is the most common etiology; post-vaccination ADEM for 5% of cases. However, ADEM that occurs after vaccination may not necessarily be attributable to the vaccine and might rather be a temporal association. In our patient, based on World Health Organization causality assessment criteria, post vaccination ADEM was very likely. Daily methylprednisolone for 3 - 5 days followed by prednisone taper is the accepted first line therapy. Plasmapheresis is recommended for steroid unresponsive patients. With early treatment initiation, full recovery is seen in 50% to 75% of patients, within 1 - 6 months. Our patient did not respond to steroids and required plasmapheresis. She showed neurologic recovery with improved MRI and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on day 42. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider post - vaccination acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in patients with encephalopathy, multifocal neurological findings and recent vaccination after carefully excluding other causes.","CSF bacterial and fungal cultures, PCR for HSV, VZV, HHV-6, enterovirus, JC and BK viruses; anti-NMDA receptor antibody and flow cytometry for lymphoma were all negative.

Yes,"This literature marketed report as received from a healthcare professional refers to a 5 year old female patient with sickle cell hemoglobin C disease. On an unknown date the patient was vaccinated with PNEUMOVAX23 dose 2 in the right arm (dose, route and indication not reported). Other suspect therapies included meningococcal conjugate vaccine (unspecified) dose 2 in the left arm on the same date. In her previous clinic review, she reported leg pain that sometimes required pain medication and headache pain in the past 4 weeks. She also had chronic splenomegaly from her sickle cell disease. At this visit she received the PNEUMOVAX23 in her right arm and meningococcal conjugate vaccine in her left arm. The patient's immunization history included one dose of PNEUMOVAX23 two and a half years earlier, and a dose of the meningococcal conjugate 6 months prior to the event. She also had received four doses of th 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, one dose of the 13-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, the hepatitis B, and annual influenza vaccinations. Her mother had previously reported that she usually developed a low grade fever after receiving vaccinations, which she would treat at home with ibuprofen. The patient's past medical history included recurrent otitis media, requiring placement of tympanostomy tubes, and asthma, She also had a history of urticarial response to fire and bites, and skin-test confirmed allergies to dust, mold, mildew and cockroaches. In this report the patient experienced an unusual severe local reaction to PNEUMOVAX23. The patient presented with arm swelling, redness and pain as well as fever and nausea after immunization during a routine follow-up visit the day before. The patient developed pain in her head, neck and arm and a fever of 102.9 degrees F in the early morning the day after receiving the vaccine. Her mother administered ibuprofen. 10 h later, the mother reported a fever of 101.3 degrees F and right arm swelling with edema to the extent that it was difficult to put a shirt sleeve over the arm. The patient was brought to the Hematology clinic where she received ketorolac for pain and ondansetron for nausea reported at the clinic. Upon examination, it was noted that the right arm was tender with redness over the lateral aspect and swelling down to the elbow. She received one dose of IV ceftriaxone, but blood culture was subsequently negative. She was discharged from the clinic with ibuprofen and morphine for break-through pain. The swelling in the right arm resolved at home within 24 h. Discussion: This patient was a young girl with sickle cell disease who presented with fever and limb swelling after a second vaccination with both PPSV23 and the meningococcal conjugate vaccine. Of note, she had received multiple doses of pneumococcal vaccines, and the PPSV23 vaccination associated with this event was administered only 2.5 years after the previous PPSV23-earlier than the 3 years recommended by guidelines. Additionally, she was 5 years old at the time of the limb swelling, much younger than those in previous reports of limb swelling after PPSV23 vaccination. The limb swelling described above can be classified as a local reaction due to vaccination as defined by The Brighton Collaboration Local Reaction Working Group for Swelling at or Near Injection Site. With a score of three from the Naranjo Algorithm for determining adverse events, the case report described above could be considered an adverse drug event. Since the swelling occurred in the same arm as the PNEUMOVAX23 injection and since it was the second PNEUMOVAX23 vaccination, it was likely that PNEUMOVAX23 caused the adverse event. It is possible that administering PNEUMOVAX23 earlier than the recommended 3 years of repeated exposures to polysaccharide capsule antigens might have been contributing factors. Additionally, the immune reaction might have been amplified by the conjugated meningococcal vaccine administered concurrently i","Blood culture, Negative, negative; Body temperature, 102.9 F; Body temperature, 101.3 F",No other medications,Splenomegaly; Headache; Pain in extremity; Sickle cell anaemia; Prophylaxis; House dust allergy; Hypersensitivity; Mycotic allergy,"Asthma; Ear tube insertion; Otitis media; Pyrexia; Urticaria; Ibuprofen, Pyrexia; Pneumococcal 13v conj vaccine, one dose, prophylaxis; Pneumococcal conj vaccine, four dose, prophylaxis; Meningococcal conj vaccine, one dose, prophylaxis; Influenza, annual, prophylaxis; Hepatitis B virus vaccine, series, prophylaxis"

Yes,"Case number PHHY2013US154709, is an initial literature report received on 31 Dec 2013. The authors discussed about a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) as a rare complication post influenza vaccination. This report refers to an 83-year-old female patient. Past medical history included hypertension, ischemic stroke and diabetes. Concomitant medications were not reported. She was vaccinated with influenza vaccine (manufacturer and batch number: not reported) on an unknown date. Five days after vaccination, she presented to a hospital with a two day history of altered mental status, weakness and fever. She was admitted to the hospital. On examination, she was obtunded, febrile with bilateral extensor plantar response and brisk reflexes. On an unknown date computed tomogram of the head was performed and it was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed protein of 136 gm/dL, glucose of 108 gm/dL, with lymphocytic pleocytosis (44 cells/microliter). She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed infectious meningoencephalitis. Her mental status declined further and she required mechanical ventilation. On an unknown date, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine showed diffuse white matter lesions involving periventricular white matter, thalamus, midbrain, dorsal brainstem, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. CSF bacterial and fungal cultures, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, human herpes virus 6, enterovirus, JC and BK viruses; anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody and flow cytometry for lymphoma were all negative. Serum studies for viral encephalitis, human immune virus and quantiferon-TB were also negative. She was given a diagnosis of post-vaccination ADEM based on the neurologic picture and MRI findings of extensive white matter changes along with recent influenza vaccination. She was treated with steroids, however she did not respond and she required plasmapheresis. It was reported that she showed neurologic recovery with improved MRI and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on day 42. The author concluded that ADEM that occurs after vaccination may not necessarily be attributable to the vaccine and might rather be a temporal association. However, the author stated that in this case it was very likely the patient had post-vaccination ADEM.","CSF cell count, Significant, 44 /ul; CSF glucose, Significant, 108 g/dl; CSF protein, Significant, 136 g/dl; Computerised tomogram, Normal, Unremarkable; Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, Significant, Diffuse white matter lesions involving periventricular white matter, thalamus, midbrain, dorsal brainstem, cerebellum and medulla oblongata, Abnormal; Physical examination, Significant, Obtunded, febrile, with bilateral extensor plantar response and brisk reflexes, Abnormal",No other medications,Mehanical ventilation; Plasmapheresis; Rehabilitation therapy; Hypertension; Diabetes mellitus,Ischaemic stroke

No,"Information has been received from a literature article concerning a 17 healthy year old female patient developed conjunctival hyperemia of her right eye and was treated with topical VIGAMOX by her primary care physician. Her optometrist diagnosed contact lens associated keratitis and prescribed loteprednol etabonate, ZYLET. On subsequent examination bilateral anterior uveitis grade as 2+ cell and 1 + flare was noted. Tropicamide 1% TID and PRED FORTE Q1 hour along with dexamethasone, TOBRADEX at bedtime were then prescribed. Reduction of inflammation was noted in one week, however the inflammation recurred as topical corticosteroid therapy was tapered. She was referred for systemic evaluation after six weeks because the inflammation remained active. Physical examination and serologic evaluations were performed by her primary care physician and a rheumatologist; however no underlying cause for her uveitis was discovered. Her maternal grandparents had rheumatoid arthritis. Four months after onset of her symptoms she was referred for uveitis consultation due to persistent inflammation despite PRED FORTE OU BID. History obtained at the time disclosed her initial GARDASIL was administered 2 weeks prior to onset of uveitis and her second vaccination was temporally associated with a flare of uveitis when her topical corticosteroid dose was reduced to twice daily. The patient and her family elected to defer the third vaccination in the series. Best corrected visual acuity at the time was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left. The conjunctiva was not injected. The cornea was normal in appearance without evidence of scarring or keratic precipitates. The anterior chamber reaction was graded as 3+ cell in both eyes. Trace vitreous cells were present in both eyes on slit lamp bio microscopy, and fluorescein angiography demonstrated late hyperfluorescence of the optic discs. Additional serologic work-up did not disclose any significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast was unremarkable. Lumbar puncture was performed with a normal opening pressure. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable. She was treated with CELEBREX 200mg twice daily and topical steroid therapy was eliminated. A trace amount of cells were observed intermittently in the anterior chamber over the course of the next three years without symptoms or sequelae of uveitis Glaucoma consultation was obtained and co-morbid pigment dispersion syndrome was excluded. CELEBREX was discontinued after 32 months of therapy and uveitis symptoms have not recurred after an additional 20 months. Best corrected visual acuity remained 20/20 in both eyes more than 4 years after onset of her symptoms. A total of 24 cases of uveitis occurred following administration of GARDASIL; the gender in all cases was female. The median age was 17.

Yes,"Case previously recorded as MA2009-2190. Initial - 07 AUG 2009: In study a 7-month-old male was vaccinated i.m. with 0.5 ml Men ACWY vaccine (batch no. 017011) on 24 FEB 2009, 23 APR 2009 and 30 JUN 2009. The subject was seen at the physician's office on 07 AUG 2009 with a history of fever and diarrhea. The examination revealed an otitis medical (assessed as not serious), with onset date on 07 AUG 2009. Diarrhea was noted as an associated symptom. During the visit the child's temperature went up, and he experienced a febrile seizure for 6 minutes (assessed as serious). He was transferred to the hospital by ambulance and was admitted on the same day. The results of a spinal tap are pending. The child remained hospitalized at the time of the report. Outcome for both events: AE persisting. Assessment: Seriousness criteria: hospitalisation, intervention, medically significant. Causality (investigator's assessment): possibly related for febrile seizure, not related for otitis media. Causality (sponsor's assessment): not related for both events. Otitis media and diarrhea occurred concurrently which may have caused the fever. A rationale for the investigator's assessment of the febrile seizure was requested since there was no time relationship. Febrile seizure is expected, otitis media is unexpected according to current IB (version 12). On the case level, the case is considered expected and possibly related. Follow-up # 1 - 19 AUG 2009: The subject also received PENTACEL, PREVNAR, Hepatitis B and ROTATEQ on 30 JUN 2009. The child was seen in the office on 07 AUG 2009 with a temperature of 103 degrees F (39.4 C). The exam revealed a left tympanic membrane that was erythematous, bulging and dull. There was fluid, which was thought to be serous although there was a thin purulent rim. While in the office, the child had a staring and stiffening spell, and his temperature at the time was 104.9 degrees (40.5 C). The child was placed on oxygen and cooled with TYLENOL and rags. This episode lasted about 6 minutes, and a second 1 minute staring spell occurred while in the office. The child was then transferred from the office to the hospital by ambulance. Laboratory reports of an evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a spinal tap performed on 07 AUG showed: glucose 76 mg/dL, protein 23.2 mg/dL, WBC 0 cumm, RBC 2 cumm, poly 0 %, mononuclear 0 %, and crenated RBC 100%. The CSF was clear, colorless and without xanthochromia, and was negative for S. pneumococci; H. influenzae type B; Group B streptococci; N. Meningitis A, Y; N. Meningitis B; E. coli and N. Meningitis C, W135. No further seizure activity was seen during the hospital stay. Diarrhea was added, assessed not serious. Outcome of febrile seizure and diarrhea: complete recovery on 07 AUG 2009. Outcome for otitis media: AE persisting. The subject was discharged from the hospital on 09 AUG 2009. Further information on the diagnosis of roseola (mentioned in the investigator's letter) was requested. Hospital admission and discharge summaries will be provided when they become available. Assessment: Seriousness criteria: hospitalisation, intervention, medically significant. Causality (investigator's assessment): the investigator stressed his assessment of the febrile seizure as possibly related to the study vaccine. He stated that he considers seizure activity within 4-6 weeks of study vaccine as possibly related to vaccine (38-day interval in this case) and that possible etiologies of the febrile seizure included:1) otitis media; 2) roseola (which was observed when the fever subsided), and 3) possible relation to study vaccine. Diarrhea and otitis media are assessed as not related. Causality (sponsor's assessment): not related for all events due to time relationship. Infectious cause most likely (exanthema subitum). Febrile seizure and diarrhea are expected, otitis media is unexpected according to current IB (version 12). On the case level, the case assessment remains expected and possi",,No other medications,Unknown,

On 31 Jul 2010, the patient experienced ataxia. On 06 Aug 2010, the patient was admitted to hospital for ataxia and abnormal white matter in the periventricular areas posteriorly. On 09 Aug 2010, the patient was discharged from hospital. At the time of reporting, the patient's condition was persisting. The investigator did suspect a possible relationship between ataxia and the study vaccine. In the absence of the investigators assessment of causality, the Novartis medical safety physician provisionally assessed the event abnormal white matter as suspected to be related to the study vaccine. Follow-up received on 20 Aug 2010: The initial report was received on 11 Aug 2010 (not 12 Aug 2010 as previously reported). Follow up received on 03 Sep 2010: The MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) showed non-specific ill-defined peri-ventricular white matter signal change posteriorly, which was consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) versus leukodystrophy versus adrenoleukodystrophy. The final diagnosis for the white matter remained undetermined. Other available lab results were either negative or within normal limits. The investigator assessed the abnormal white matter as suspected to be related to the study vaccine. Follow up received on 10 Sep 2010: The investigator confirmed that the date of the varicella vaccine was 02 Jul 2010, not 07 Jul 2010. Follow up received on 30 Nov 2010: The investigator confirmed that the patient dropped out of the study due to the events. On 06 Aug 2010, the patient again experienced ataxia.

The patient's cortisol and lysosomal enzymes were normal. On 16 Oct 2010, the patient was discharged from hospital, with plans to revaluate when the patient was 2 years of age. The patient's outcome was reported as event persisting. In the absence of the investigators assessment of causality, the Novartis medical safety physician provisionally assessed the second occurrence of ataxia as suspected to be related to the study vaccine. Follow up received on 09 Dec 2010, prior to circulation of previous follow up: The final diagnosis was confirmed as ataxia. The patient's final outcome was reported as condition improving. The investigator assessed the ataxia (onset date 31 Jul 2010) as non serious ""at this time"" and suspected to be related to the study vaccine. Follow up received on 18 Jan 2011: The investigator stated that based on clinical and neurological MRI findings in Aug 2010 and Oct 2010 a disorder of myelinization was found which was consistent with ADEM.

No,"This literature marketed report as received from a other health care professional refers to 4 patients of unknown age and gender. Although current rotavirus vaccines were not associated with an increased risk of intussusceptions in large trials before licensure, recent post-licensure data from international settings suggest the possibility of a small increase in risk of intussusceptions after monovalent rotavirus vaccination. Participants were infants between the ages of 4 and 34 weeks who were enrolled in six integrated health care organizations in a project. Medical records were reviewed and visits for intussusception within 7 days after monovalent rotavirus vaccination from April 2008 through March 2013. Using sequential analyses, then compared the risk of intussusception among children receiving monovalent rotavirus vaccine with historical background rates. Authors further compared the risk after monovalent rotavirus vaccination with the risk in a concurrent cohort of infants who received the ROTATEQ vaccine. During the study period, 207,955 doses of monovalent rotavirus vaccine (including 115,908 first doses and 92,047 second doses) were administered in the population. Authors identified 6 cases of intussusception within 7 days after the administration of either dose of vaccine. For the two doses combined, the expected number of intussusception cases was 0.72, resulting in a significant relative risk of 8.4. For the ROTATEQ vaccine, 1,301,810 doses were administered during the study period, with 8 observed intussusception cases (7.11 expected), for a nonsignificant relative risk of 1.1. The relative risk of chart-confirmed intussusception within 7 days after monovalent rotavirus vaccination, as compared with the risk after ROTATEQ vaccination, was 9.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 103.8). The attributable risk of intussusception after the administration of two doses of monovalent rotavirus vaccine was estimated to be 5.3 per 100,000 infants vaccinated. Six of the 9 cases (67%) after pentavalent rotavirus vaccination were confirmed as Brighton Collaboration level 1; the other 3 were determined not to be cases of intussusception. The 6 cases of intussusception after ROTATEQ vaccination occurred after the administration of 999,123 doses. Updated analysis of ROTATEQ vaccination included nearly 1.3 million doses and continued to find no significant increased risk of intussusception. The relative risk after the first dose of the ROTATEQ vaccine was 2.63 (95% CI, 0.72 to 6.74). This analysis included all electronically recorded diagnoses without chart confirmation of cases; after medical-record review, only two of the four cases that occurred after the receipt of dose 1 were confirmed. Thus, in the population, there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine was associated with an increased risk of intussusception, so the ROTATEQ vaccine served as an appropriate comparator for assessing risks after monovalent rotavirus vaccination. On an unknown date, the patients were vaccinated with ROTATEQ dose and route not reported. No concomitant medication reported. On an unknown date, the patients experienced intussusception (medically significant) after Dose 3 of ROTATEQ. The outcome of intussusception was not reported.

The health professional reported that the patient received FLUMIST QUAD nine days ago on 27-Nov-2013 and developed hives seven days ago, and was tested positive for the flu with fever and congestion which started on 04-Dec-2013. He was seen at the doctor's office on 04-Dec-13 and prescribed ORAPRED 49 ML for three days. The patient was taking a dose of 8.2 ML of ORAPRED three times a day. He came back to the physician's office on 06-Dec-2013 as his condition worsened and was prescribed ORAPRED of 50 ML again for three days for his symptoms. Patient had erythema multiforme, possible virus infection, bruising, joint swelling, angioedema, and possible hypersensitivity reaction. Patient was treated with prednisone, BENADRYL and ZYRTEC. The outcome of erythema multiforme, angioedema, tested positive for flu, fever, congestion, bruising and joint swelling was unknown, the patient recovered from the hypersensitivity reaction or viral infection on an unspecified date, and at the time of reporting, the hives were ongoing. The reporter assessed the events of tested positive for flu, hypersensitivity reaction vs viral infection, fever, congestion, and hives to be non-serious. The company physician identified erythema multiforme from the source document and added it as a serious adverse event (seriousness criterion of important medical event) while bruising, angioedema, and joint swelling were judged non-serious. Follow-up information received by AstraZeneca/MedImmune on 21-Jan-2014 from a health professional upgraded this case to globally expedited: Serious event of erythema multiforme was added.

Yes,"(VAERS filed) in OCT 1986, he was in his usual state of excellent health and felt well on the day of vaccine receipt. He does not recall any symptoms of recent respiratory or gastrointestinal infections. To the best of his recollection, the flu vaccine was the only vaccine that he received on that day. He had typically received flu vaccines annually and had experienced mild, flu-like symptoms post-vaccination, but not after every flu vaccine; with previous reactions, his symptoms usually never lasted more than a few days. In 1986, pt does not recall any significant swelling, redness, tenderness, or itching at vaccination site. Pt also denies symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction following vaccine receipt-no flushing, itching, dyspnea, hives, facial swelling, and itching or swelling of throat and/or tongue within the 1st 48 hours of vaccine receipt. Pt's reaction began approximately 2-5 days after vaccine receipt when he began feeling feverish (his wife checked his temperature, and while he does not recall specifics, he knows it was elevated > 100 degrees) and he was shivering. He also experienced severe headaches, fatigue (describes overall energy level at that time as 30% of his baseline (100%), runny nose, and a dry, hacking cough. The day after symptom onset, when he awoke, he felt even worse and went on Sick Call. He was given a cold pack and placed on qtrs x2-3 days, and then he stayed in bed through the subsequent weekend. In addition to the cold pack, he used a vaporizer at home for 1 week, but did not think it helped. The following Monday (approximately 1 week post-vaccination), his symptoms continued with the same intensity, except his fever, chills, and runny nose had improved, while his coughing episodes had increased. When he went on sick call again, he was placed on qtrs again x1 week. His sxs continued another 10 days, except the fevers, chills, and runny nose resolved during this time frame. His cough was triggered anytime he tried to exert himself and remained unproductive. His headaches continued to be ""severe"", but over the next 2 weeks, improved. His cough, however, continued approximately 5-6 weeks post vaccination. By this time, pt had been back to work for a couple of weeks. He thought he might gradually regain his energy and stamina if he resumed running; after jogging 1 mile, he felt okay, but at the end of the run, he describes himself as ""incapacitated...coughing for twenty minutes straight"". A couple of days later, he tried running again and experienced a similar episode. Over the next month, this continued, with improvement of fatigue and coughing only after exertion, especially after running. After another month, he was no longer coughing at the end of his runs and he was feeling like he was almost back to his baseline. Pt's sxs did not recur until around OCT 1987. He was in another state and had not received the flu vaccine, but reports he experienced fatigue and a dry, hacking cough, associated with exertion. He did not experience fevers and chills, and he did not experience severe headaches, but may have experienced intermittent, moderate headaches. He rested for 3 days after onset and felt better, except the cough persisted. Just as with the previous year, patient gradually resumed running and experienced severe coughing episodes upon completion. This gradually improved over a 6-week period before resolving. Around the end of OCT or beginning of NOV 1988, while in another country, pt's cough returned, and was once again associated with exertion, and persisted about 3-4 weeks. He had not received a flu vaccine in 1988 prior to the return of his cough. His coughing episodes have not recurred since 1988.

The subject's ethnicity was stated and he was homeschooled at the time of the event. On 26 June 2012 he had stepped on a rusty boat anchor and sustained a puncture wound to his foot while working outdoors for a sailing program. He had cleaned the wound with hydrogen peroxide. He had experienced mild pain but no local erythema, swelling or drainage from the wound. No further information on his medical family history or concurrent medication is available. On an unspecified date, the subject might have received an unspecified dose of Diphtheria tetanus acellular pertussis (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided) during childhood. However, there was no record of him receiving any vaccination in his school, primary care physician's office or in the state immunisation registry. On 30 June 2012, at an unspecified time after vaccination with Diphtheria tetanus acellular pertussis, the subject experienced tightness of neck muscles and jaw. The symptoms had worsened during the day and he had developed pleuritic chest pain too. The subject was hospitalised for 5 days. No details of any laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures have been provided. Diagnosis was tetanus infection. Initial treatment consisted of wound cleaning and administration of 250 U of human tetanus immune globulin, tetanus toxoid vaccine, and 500 mg of metronidazole. He was then transferred to a tertiary medical centre where he received 2 mg of lorazepam and was admitted to the general paediatric ward. During his hospitalization there, he received 500 mg of metronidazole every 8 hours for 5 days and an additional 6000 U of human tetanus immune globulin. Outcome was complete recovery with discharge from the hospital without sequelae on 4 July 2012.

The subject had received the vaccine previously with no documented adverse reaction. No further information on his medical or family history or any concurrent medications at the time of the event is available. On an unspecified date, the subject received unspecified dose of Hepatitis B vaccine (unknown route and injection site; lot number not provided).

He also reported a mild frontal headache. At 2 days after vaccination with Hepatitis B vaccine, the subject was transferred from the nursing home due to an abnormally low platelet count (3000/ mm3) found on a blood test. Physical examination revealed ecchymosis, conjunctival haemorrhage and mucoasl bleeding in the mouth. The subject was hospitalised. On admission, the results of analytical tests were: white blood count of 11,200/mm3, haemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, platelet count of 3000/mm3, and peripheral smear showed no schistocytes, clumping and normal platelet morphology; prothrombin time and active partial thromboplastin time were normal as were assays for heparin-induced antibodies, heparin induced platelet aggregation, antinuclear antibodies.

He had received the vaccine previously with no documented adverse reaction. No concomitant medications were reported. On an unknown date (reported as two days after the vaccination) the patient was transferred from nursing home to a hospital due to an abnormally low platelet count (3000/ mm3) found on a blood test. The patient had noticed bruising around his left eye, hemorrhagic blebs on his tongue, hematuria, tarry stools and diffuse ecchymosis over his extremities. He also reported a mild frontal headache. Physical examination revealed ecchymosis, conjunctival haemorrhage and mucosal bleeding in the mouth. A CT head on an unknown date showed no intracranial haemorrhage. On admission, the results of analytical tests were: white blood count of 11,200/mm3, haemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, platelet count of 3000/mm3, and peripheral smear showed no schistocytes, clumping and normal platelet morphology. On an unknown date prothrombin time and active partial thromboplastin time were normal. Assays for heparin-induced antibodies, heparin induced platelet aggregation, antinuclear antibodies were normal on an unknown date. On an unknown date serological assays for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and Human immunodeficiency virus were negative. He was initially transfused single donor platelets with no improvement in the platelet count. A diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (life threatening, hospitalization) was made on an unknown date. The patient was started on IV SOLUMEDROL, intravenous immunoglobulin and aminocaproic acid. By the end of the fifth day, the platelet count was 102,000/mm3 and was 259,000/mm3 at discharge. He was sent to the nursing home on tapering oral steroids for a month. Platelet counts remained normal on a six month follow up on an unknown date. The event was considered as recovered. The author stated that the vaccine is usually well tolerated, with few side effects; but several cases of thrombocytopenia after recombinant vaccine have been described. ITP is thought to be caused by the presence of autoantibodies to glycoprotein II b/III a molecules present in the platelet membrane. Repeated doses of vaccine may function as a booster to autoantibody formation. The patient had rapid onset of thrombocytopenia. The author stated that immune thrombocytopenia can be a potential life threatening complication of Hepatitis B vaccination in adults.

No,"In discussing the zoster vaccine with my doctor, I asked about side effects. She indicated that she had given many of these vaccines and had not had any patients who experienced side effects. I had the vaccine on 12/2/13. Within a day or so, I developed extreme sensitivity on the right side of my body both in my hip/top of right thigh area and also near my back left shoulder area including very sharp, intense shooting pains. I then developed an outbreak/rash on the back of my upper right thigh. I went back to Dr. on 12/18. While she was surprised at my symptoms and the rash, she was in agreement that the rash did appear to be a shingles rash. So, it appears I developed a mild case of shingles directly after receiving the vaccine. Please note: I do not remember having chicken pox as a child and my mother said I never did even though my siblings did have chicken pox.

Yes,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of pertussis in a 43-year-old male subject who was vaccinated with DTP (manufacturer unspecified), DTPa ((with small D + P), manufacturer unspecified). The subject was healthy. There was an outbreak of pertussis less than 20 miles away from subject's place. On unspecified dates, the subject received primary course of DTP (unknown route, injection site and batch number), booster dose of DTPa (with small D + P) (unknown route, injection site and batch number). At an unspecified time after vaccination with DTP, 1 year after vaccination with booster dose of DTPa (with small D + P), the subject presented to the emergency department with continued shortness of breath and a two week history of low grade fever and non-productive cough without whoop. He had previously been seen twice in his primary care provider's office with complaints of and an initial sore throat. After his first visit, he was thought to have a viral upper respiratory tract infection and was given supportive care. After 7 days, he was placed on prednisone and Albuterol for putative bronchospastic complications manifesting as occasional wheezing. The symptoms failed to improve requiring hospitalization for further management. The subject complained of dyspnea at rest and on exertion but denied hemoptysis or chest pain. An exam was notable for hypoxia (85% on room air) with dry rales and end-expiratory wheezing, without respiratory distress. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable. The chest radiograph and computerized tomography scan did not demonstrate signs of infection. Because of the lack of specific findings, prolonged symptoms and significant hypoxia, atypical infections were considered. Serology for mycoplasma, chlamydia and Bordetella were sent. Bordetella IgM and IgG titers were significantly elevated. The subject was diagnosed with pertussis which was considered as a vaccination failure. At the time of reporting the outcome of the events were resolved. Author's comment: despite advancements in vaccination, cases of pertussis are still seen sporadically in the adult population. In this case, despite a recent well-publicized outbreak less than 20 miles away, providers did not consider a vaccination failure due to this assumption, resulting in significant morbidity requiring hospitalization. Therefore, although rare, pertussis vaccination failure does occur, and should be considered in the workup for a coughing illness lasting more than 5 days, even without the classic whoop.","Bordetella test, significantly el; Chest X-ray, no signs of infe; Computerized tomogram, no signs of infe; Laboratory test, unremarkable; An exam was notable for hypoxia (85% on room air) with dry rales and end-expiratory wheezing, without respiratory distress.",,Unknown,

No,"Initial report was received from the scientific literature on 30 January 2014. The following is verbatim from the abstract: Background. Each year, the Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network examines the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in preventing medically attended acute respiratory illnesses cause by influenza. Methods. Patients with acute respiratory illnesses of 7 days duration were enrolled at ambulatory care facilities in 5 communities. Specimens were collected and tested for influenza by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Receipt of influenza vaccine was defined based on documented evidence of vaccination in medical records or immunization registries. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated in adjusted logistic regression models by comparing the vaccination coverage in those who tested positive for influenza with those who tested negative. Results. The 2011-2012 season was mild and peaked late, with circulation of both type A viruses and both lineages of type B. Overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36-56) in preventing medically attended influenza; vaccine effectiveness was 65% (95% CI, 44-79) against type A (H1N1) pdm09 but only 39% (95% CI, 23-52) against type A (H3N2). Estimates of vaccine effectiveness against both type B lineages were similar (overall, 58%; 95% CI, 35-73). An apparent negative effect of prior year vaccination on current year effectiveness estimates was noted, particularly for A (H3N2) outcomes. Conclusions. Vaccine effectiveness in the 2011-2012 season was modest overall, with lower effectiveness against the predominant A (H3N2) virus. This may be related to antigenic drift, but past history of vaccination might also play a role. The following is verbatim from the full article: A cluster of 213 patient of all ages (initials, gender and date of birth was not reported) had received a dose of Influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown, batch number, dose in series, route and site of administration was not reported) on an unspecified date.

The following is verbatim from the aforementioned article abstract: Introduction: Gelatin is a mixture of peptides and proteins produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from cow, pig, and fish. It is found in various foods, beverages, medications, plasma expanders, and vaccines. We present a case report of a 4-year-old patient with anaphylaxis to the influenza vaccine who was referred for evaluation of egg allergy, but was found to also have significant gelatin IgE sensitization. Methods: The patient was evaluated with both skin prick testing and serum levels of gelatin-specific IgE. Results: The patient was avoiding unbaked egg secondary to a history of perioral rash with ingestion of meringue icing, but the parents were more acutely concerned about an egg allergy given a recent reaction to the influenza vaccine. He had received the influenza vaccine in the past without any issue, but that year he developed diffuse hives, watery eyes, sneezing, and vomiting within 15 minutes of receiving the immunization. Upon further food reaction history, the patient's mother endorsed that in the past he developed a watery mouth, abdominal pain, and weakness with ingestion of gummy candies, gummy vitamins, and marshmallows. Skin prick testing showed a wheal of 4 mm and flare of 21 mm with commercial egg extract, and a wheal of 13 mm and flare of 33 mm with fresh gelatin [Knox, non-kosher]. Serum testing showed an IgE level of 4.76 kIU/L for egg white and 0.39 kIU/L for bovine gelatin [ImmunoCAP, ARUP Laboratories]. We offered follow up skin prick testing with fish derived gelatin to determine if the patient could tolerate non mammalian gelatin but the family declined further testing. We recommended avoidance of all foods containing unbaked egg and gelatin, and the family opted to defer additional immunization with gelatin containing vaccines. We prescribed an epinephrine auto injector, provided an emergency action plan, and reviewed the management of food allergies. Conclusion: Gelatin allergy should be considered in any patient with a history of reaction to gelatin containing foods or pharmaceutical products. Management of gelatin allergy includes provision of thorough avoidance measures, prescription of epinephrine, and periodic reevaluation to determine if oral food challenges should be considered with decreasing IgE levels and skin prick testing. A 4-year-old male patient had received a dose of influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown, batch number, route and anatomical site of administration not reported) on an unspecified date. The patient was avoiding unbaked egg secondary to a history of perioral rash with ingestion of meringue icing. The patient had a history of watery mouth, abdominal pain, and weakness with ingestion of gummy candies, gummy vitamins, and marshmallows. On an unspecified date, the patient developed diffuse hives, watery eyes, sneezing, and vomiting within 15 minutes of receiving the immunization. Skin prick testing showed a wheal of 4 mm and flare of 21 mm with commercial egg extract, and a wheal of 13 mm and flare of 33 mm with fresh gelatin [Knox, non-kosher]. Serum testing showed an IgE level of 4.76 kIU/L for egg white and 0.39 kIU/L for bovine gelatin.

Yes,"Even though I personally informed Dr. that I recently had a tetanus/pneumonia/flu vaccine (on 10/21/11) he insisted I needed a pneumonia vaccine. He had his nurse administer a pneumonia vaccine on 8/28/13 despite the fact that it had been less than 2 years and it's good for 5 yrs. I am an 82 year old who until 12/31/12 received my medical care at another location. I joined the HMO effective 1/1/13. I saw Dr. on two visits (1/2/13 and 6/5/13) before this painful event (8/28/13). Dr.'s office phoned me three times between the June and August visits for me to come in for a pneumonia vaccine. On each occasion I informed them that I already had that vaccine which I understood protects me for five years. I made the 8/28/13 appointment to discuss two problems: 1) My feet were partially asleep up to an area above the ankle and with a burning, tingling sensation. 2) A back pain in the kidneys area. When I arrived, the nurse asked me if I was there for my pneumonia shot. I stated once more that I already had that vaccine. Then, when Dr. came in, the first thing he wanted to discuss was the pneumonia vaccine. For the fifth time I repeated that I already had a tetanus/pneumonia/flu shot in October of 2011. His response to me was: ""This is not the same thing. This is a single pneumococcus shot and you need it."" My common sense told me I did not need the shot, but like most persons I chose not to argue with my doctor and I consented to receiving the shot. Doctor's nurse administered the vaccine on the upper left shoulder area. The doctor ordered lab work to determine if the back pain was caused by kidney stones and gave me a prescription for 10 mg of Nortriptyline HCL for me feet problem. Everything was normal for the next four hours after receiving the shot. Then, suddenly, I was hit by an excruciating pain in the area where I was given the shot. I was driving my wife to a doctor's appointment which is near a hospital. I checked in at the emergency while my wife drove to her doctor's appointment. The emergency doctor told me that I should go to the other emergency facility since they administered the shot. No examination or test was performed. They gave me an arm sling. When my wife returned from her doctor's appointment, she drove me home, a distance of approximately 50 miles. I took two 500 mg pills of TYLENOL every two hours (a total of 6 pills) with no relief. So, I finally asked my wife to drive me to the hospital emergency on the evening of 8/28/13. The pain would not subside. Only after they administered a heavy dose of morphine did I begin to get some relief. Staff gave me a prescription for Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen and discharged me with instruction to call Dr. the next day. If I do not ever see or speak to Dr. that would be too soon. There is no way I can adequately explain the pain I have been going through with a vaccination I did not need. I have not been to office since. I returned to another facility as a patient. I saw Dr. on 12 Nov, 2013. My wife was present. Dr. confirmed that on 10/21/11 I received a tetanus/pneumonia/flu shot at the facility. I gave her the precise date because I had made a written note to myself when I received the shot. Dr. ordered left shoulder X-rays, lab work and reinstated my medications. Dr. recommended physical therapy. The X-ray showed nothing abnormal. Because they are overloaded with physical therapy requests and because I live so far away, I decided to bide my time and hope that the injury would eventually heal itself. Meanwhile I have been favoring my left arm and containing the pain with ALEVE and TYLENOL. The pain has been a throbbing pain centered where I received the shot and its severity increases during sleeping hours. Sometimes it feels like the elbow to shoulder bone hurts and occasionally the pain travels to the heart area. I have never been diagnosed with heart problems. It has been six months since the vaccination. I am slowly regaining strength and use of my left arm although i",,,,

This 75-year-old male subject (BMI 53.0) (center number unknown) was enrolled in a study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a cell-based quadrivalent subunit influenza and cell-based trivalent subunit influenza in adults ages >=18 years of age. The ongoing medical history of the subject included borderline hypertension (since 2006) and sleep apnea (since 1992, type of sleep apnea not available). It was reported that the subject was overweight (since 1968), body mass index 53.0. Concomitant medications at the time of enrollment included ibuprofen, glucosamine and multivitamin. The subject received study vaccine on 05 Dec 2013 at 15:33 hours (visit 1). The subject blood pressure was at 133/91 mmHg, and physical examination revealed normal results (not specified). On 19 Dec 2013, the PCP referred the subject to a cardiologist, and lisinopril was added to the subject therapy for hypertension. The treatment detail for sleep apnea was not provided. On 09 Jan 2014, the subject visited the cardiologist and presented with shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion and increased swelling in the lower extremities. The subject was then sent to the emergency room (same day) and tests revealed pulse at 130 /min, blood pressure at 145/90 mmHg, oxygen saturation at 94% and ejection fraction (EF) was 50 - 55%. An ECG revealed atrial fibrillation and a transesophageal ECG which was consistent with clinical diagnosis of congestive heart failure. The subject was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and congestive heart failure and was admitted on the same day. On the same day, an echocardiogram was performed which was within normal limits, showed mild pulmonary hypertension, no mass or thrombus was noted. The subject received treatment with diuretics (intravenous LASIX) and was placed on DIGOXIN (intravenous). Laboratory tests revealed red blood cell count (RBC) at 4.05, haemoglobin (hgb) at 13.2, hematocrit (HCT) at 38.9. The subjects serum electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver function tests and thyroid profile revealed normal results. On 10 Jan 2014, the subject had an electrical cardioversion. On the same day, the subject received DIGOXIN orally. A chest x-ray performed on 10 Jan 2014, revealed midline trachea, stable cardiomediastinal silhouette (left costophrenic angles was not included), right mid lung scarring and probable basilar layering effusions. On 12 Jan 2014, the subject recovered completely from the events of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and congestive heart failure and was discharged on the same day. The investigator considered the events of with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and congestive heart failure to be serious (hospitalization). The investigator reported that the event of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was suspected to treatment with study vaccine and congestive heart failure as not suspected to treatment with study vaccine. The investigator stated rationale for causality assessment to study treatment that the timing of the vaccine and onset of symptoms raised suspicion of possible link. He also stated that the link is possible though unlikely. The investigator reported that the subjects risk factors predispose to cardiac disease and could contribute to these issues. Other possible contributory factors for the event of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate were reported as hypertension and obesity.

But I am not concerned about anything other than getting better and to the bottom of my illness. Ironically, when I contacted you the thing you told me to do was to go to the doctor. Well, I went yesterday 1-7-2014. And they could not find anything that was too unreal. The doctor told me my blood pressure was up. I had not taken the B/P meds prescribed because I couldn't function. The main thing that made me feel better was the pain in my (Rt) side of face sinus areas and ear were found. But my left ear was unable to be seen clearly due to white matter. My (Rt) ear was tender due to me always touching it by it being itchy and painful. Then I remembered - I just underwent a complete house clean-up due to mildew on the walls. And at about the same time I got the flu shot. I was in contact with going into a closet and finding mold. This is one of my biggest allergies. I had a Dr check for mold problems in Feb 2012. When I found the walls mildewed. Areas were repainted and treated. I have been hard of hearing for a while. People would ask me why am I hollering. So, it's possible I already had sinus or nasal problems. Because I was on FLONASE nasal spray before. So, the Dr Rx was FLONASE both nostrils. She stated if I had problems with the nose I possibly couldn't smell. That sounds normal for me. So, I'm O.K. I'm just better to know there's a reason. The flu-like symptoms, are getting weaker and weaker, On the 7th of this month it was not too bad. I've also tried to increase vitamins and stay in more and away from other sick people.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) comprises of several signs and symptoms that denote kidney damage, which include proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. In addition, immune abnormalities have been reported to be associated with NS. We present 3 patients with congenital NS who demonstrate unique patterns of immune deficiency and illustrate the importance of immune evaluation in this condition. Case Report: Three 4-year old patients (two males and one female) presented with chronic nasal congestion, recurrent otitis and a history of frequent relapsing idiopathic minimal change NS. Immune evaluation revealed normal lymphocyte subsets, IgA and IgM, as well as protective antibody titers for tetanus and diphtheria. However, they were found to have IgG 300-400 and non-protective pneumococcal antibodies despite vaccination. Variability was present in lymphocyte mitogen stimulation test with low pokeweed mitogen simulation response. This case report refer to a 4 year old female patient. Conclusion: Children with NS may have a high prevalence of impaired antibody response to pneumococci and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, which may lead to susceptibility to bacterial infections, particularly pneumococci. Thus, immune evaluation is warranted in this condition regardless of remission state. This is one of several reports received from the same source.

Yes,"This medically confirmed literature report (initial receipt 04-Feb-2014) concerns a 34 year old male patient who had no history of recent travel or exposure to insects. His sibling had a history of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) with Hodgkin's lymphoma. On an unspecified date, the patient received a influenza virus vaccine (manufacturer and batch number not provided). On an unspecified date, the patient presented with bilateral facial weakness and difficulty drinking. He had lower extremity tingling sensation and was evaluated at the emergency department one week before presenting. He had no complaints of extremity weakness, no changes in vision and hearing and no history of fever or headache. He received the flu shot ten days before presentation. On examination, the patient was found to have bilateral lower motor neuron facial palsy with Bell's phenomenon but no other focal neurological deficits. His white blood cell count was elevated to 13.18. An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) of the brain showed four millimetre lesions in the left centrum semiovale demonstrating enhancement and two other non-enhancing lesions in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum. A lumbar puncture showed a high white cell count containing all lymphocytes and monocytes with elevated protein. A presumptive diagnosis of neurological Lyme's disease was made and the patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone. However Lyme antibody, blood and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) Lyme PCR (polymerase chain reaction) were negative. Serology for syphilis, West Nile virus, HIV, VZV (varicella zoster virus) were also negative. Cryptococcal CSF antigen was also negative. Serum ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) level was within normal limits. The patient had gradual improvement of his facial weakness. He was treated with a rapidly tapering course of prednisolone for six days. He received ceftriaxone for 14 days intravenously. His facial palsy had nearly completely resolved. Outcome was reported as recovering. Reporter comments: Literature reviews showed most of bilateral Bell's palsy are caused by Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, HIV and EBV. There was a single case reported after intranasal influenza vaccine but no case reported after inactivated flu vaccine injection.","Lumbar puncture, Abnormal; Lyme antibody, Normal; Lyme PCR, Normal; MRI, Abnormal; Serum ACE level, Normal; White blood cell count, 13.18 Unknown; Serology, Normal; HIV, Normal; Syphilis, Normal",,,

Yes,"A 31 year old female presented to clinic after a recent hospitalization with pancytopenia ""suspected to be secondary to a viral infection. She was confirmed to have West Nile virus meningitis and presumed herpes simplex virus (HSV) meningitis. Lab work was remarkable for low immunoglobulins at that time, and she presented to author's clinic for further workup. The patient had a self-reported history of recurrent infections requiring intermittent antibiotics since childhood. Additional complaints included chronic fatigue and persistent viral infections with recurrent ""cold sores"" on the outside of her lips (~2 times/month) that clinically seemed to be consistent with HSV. She had no history of atopy or recurrent Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or zoster infections. Humoral immunity was re-evaluated a few months after hospitalization and showed persistent abnormalities: IgG 589 mg/dL, IgA 63, and IgM 31. There was normal responses to Dt vaccines, but only 1/14 protective pneumococcal titers 18 months after receiving the PNEUMOVAX 23 (dose, route not reported). Flow cytometry was repeated multiple times which consistently showed low levels of natural killer (NK) cells: 1% and 32 cells/mcl. An NK cell cytotoxicity assay was performed and showed decreased NK cell absolute counts and cytotoxic activity. Based upon clinical history and lab results, the diagnosis of NK cell deficiency was made. She was started on prophylactic acyclovir 400mg, oral, twice a day for a 3 month trial period. After only a few weeks of treatment, the patient noted significant improvement in viral-related symptoms. Conclusion: This case report confirmed that in addition to a detailed clinical history and a high level of suspicion, flow cytometry followed by NK cell cytotoxicity testing was a simple and effective way to evaluate NK cell deficiencies. It also highlighted the importance of keeping this disorder in the differential diagnosis, especially in cases of unexplained recurrent viral infections.

The literature backgroup was to describe population-based rates of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV40 vaccine uptake and coverage from its licensure in June 2006 through December 2008. In this period, quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recomb. vaccine (manufacturer unknown) was licensed for use in 9-26 year old females. Methods: Data were from 4 managed care organizations in the Vaccine Safety Data link. It was described uptake of quadrivalent human papilloma virus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recomb. vaccine (manufacturer unknown) (number of doses given per month) in all persons aged 0-39, and coverage (percentage of eligible persons who received 2:1 dose) in all females aged 0-39, stratified by age and history of HPV-related disease. Results: In this study period, 166,975 quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11, 16, 18) recomb. vaccine (manufacturer unknown) doses were administered to 79,235 persons, with the greatest number given in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2007. The therapy of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recomb. vaccine (manufacturer unknown) coverage increased steadily; by December 2008, coverage rates were 1% (females 9-10 years old), 34% (11-12), 55% (13-17), and 36% (18/26). The rate of increase in coverage was reduced by late 2008. After mid-2007, females aged 9-26 with a history of HPV-related disease had significantly lower rates of HPV4 vaccination than those without HPV disease. It was reported that minimal off-label use occurred: 6 males received vaccine; 153 doses were given to girls < 9 years old, and 3,518 doses to women 27-29 years old.

The literature background was to describe population-based rates of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV4) vaccine uptake and coverage from its licensure in June 2006 through December 2008. In this period, quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recomb. vaccine (manufacturer unknown) was licensed for use in 9-26 year old females. Methods: Data were from 4 managed care organizations in the Vaccine Safety Data link. It was described uptake of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recomb. vaccine (manufacturer unknown) (number of doses given per month) in all persons aged 0-39, and coverage (percentage of eligible persons who received 2:1 dose) in all females aged 0-39, stratified by age and history of HPV-related disease. Results: In this study period, 166,975 quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recomb. vaccine (manufacturer unknown) doses were administered to 79,235 persons, with the greatest number given in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2007. The therapy of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recomb. vaccine (manufacturer unknown) coverage increased steadily; by December 2008, coverage rates were 1% (female 9-10 years old), 34% (11-12), 55% (13-17), and 36% (18-26). The rate of increase in coverage was reduced by late 2008. After mid-2007, female aged 9-26 with a history of HPV-related disease had significantly lower rates of HPV4 vaccination than those without HPV disease.

Yes,"Information has been received from a healthcare professional, author of the published literature study. The case patient was identified as part of a large prospective HZ study in progress at a clinic. She was a 68-year-old woman who received ZOSTAVAX in her left deltoid region in March 2012. She presented to the outpatient clinic in December 2012 with a 3-day history of rash, mild but annoying pain, and burning sensation on her left mid-chest and mid-back and under the left upper arm the day before visit. The linear pattern was consistent with T1 dermatomal distribution. She reported no prodromal pain but experienced more hot flashes lately. Her past medical history revealed no immunosuppressive conditions or medications, and the patient had an uncertain history of varicella. Her doctor diagnosed HZ and she was treated with acyclovir (800mg 5 times a day for 10 days) and acetaminophen for pain. Both rash and pain resolved within 10 days and the patient experienced no complications (recovered on approximately December 2012). The National VZV Laboratory of the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention performs VZV strain identification for specimens submitted from patients with clinically diagnosed HZ at the clinic. Two swab specimens of lesion fluid/basal cells and 2 slide scrapings were collected and shipped dry at ambient temperature. Isolates were identified as strains originating from Oka vaccine via FRET real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), an approach that discriminates vaccine from wild type VZV by melt curve analysis; four different assays targeting single polymorph isms (SNP) in open-reading frames (ORFs) 38, 54, and 62 each distinguish vaccine and wild type VZV as described elsewhere. The fixed ORF62 SNP at positions 106262 and 107252 definitively identified this isolate as Oka vaccine. In accordance with VZV nomenclature parameters established in 2010, this isolate has been named VZVs #KF811485. The complete sequence data for this isolate revealed no evidence for mixed markers across the entire genome, indicating that the isolate is clonal, i.e., a single vaccine-associated strain was responsible for this case. The isolate carried 15 of 42 (36%) vaccine SNP identified by Gomi et al and carried all four fixed vaccine SNP in ORF 62 (105705, 106262, 107252 and 108111) as well as the single fixed SNP located in ORFO (non-coding region, position 560). Nine SNP occurring as mixed markers (strains carrying either the vaccine or wild type base are present in the vaccine) in ZOSTAVAX were present as the wild type marker in VZVs, five of which were non-synonymous, leading to an amino acid substitution in their respective encoded protein (5745 (ORF6), 31732 (ORF21), 101089 (ORF59), 105310 (ORF62), and 111650 (ORF64). Limited evaluation of the amino acid sequence changes revealed that none of the changes was predicted to alter protein function using the Provean software. Three vaccine-associated SNP that appeared to be fixed in Merck carried the wild type nucleotide in VZVs (703 (ORF1), 105356 and 107136 (ORF62). all of these were synonymous changes resulting in no differences in the respective proteins. Finally there were 9 SNP that were unique to isolate VZVs, located in ORF 11 (15865), ORF 17 (24651, ORF28 (50382), ORF33/33.5 (61029), ORF34 (63723), ORF44 (80966), ORF62 (106650 an 108505) and a non-coding region between ORF61 and ORF62 (104971); four of these lead to an amino acid substitution. These changes were also not predicted to alter protein function. Discussion Like wild-type VZV, vaccine Oka is capable of establishing latency in neurons following varicella vaccination and reactivating at a later time to cause HZ. This phenomenon has been well documented in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals, though HZ due to vOka appears to be uncommon. We provide evidences indicating that vOka found in zoster vaccine can establish latency and reactivate to cause clinical zoster.

Yes,"Initial report was received from literature on 11 February 2014. The following is verbatim from the article abstract: Although influenza vaccines have saved millions of lives, some have been associated with extremely rare adverse effects such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, Bell's palsy, and optic neuritis. Despite the fact that olfactory loss after an influenza vaccination is noted in one case report, no quantitative olfactory testing was performed. Hence, it is unclear whether, in fact, olfactory dysfunction can be associated with such vaccinations. This study was designed to (1) identify patients from the Center who attributed their empirically determined chemosensory disturbances to influenza vaccinations and (2) determine whether influenza vaccinations add to the degree of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction due to other causes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of self-reported etiologies of 4554 consecutive patients presenting to the Center with complaints of chemosensory dysfunction was performed. Those who reported dysfunction secondary to influenza vaccinations were identified. Additionally, in a subset of 925 patients for whom detailed inoculation histories were available, it was determined whether the number of lifetime inoculations added to the deficits due to other causes. Results: Nine of the 4554 patients (0.19%) attributed olfactory disturbances to an influenza vaccination. None complained of taste dysfunction. All nine had abnormally low scores on the Smell Identification Test (p < 0.001), with three being anosmic and six microsmic. Seven had elevated phenyl ethyl alcohol detection thresholds (p < 0.05). Two cases exhibited mild-to-moderate loss of whole mouth taste function. Of the 925 patients, no association was evident between the number of lifetime vaccinations and the chemosensory test scores. In accord with previous studies, age and sex were significantly related to the test scores. Conclusion: A very small percentage of the 4554 patients evaluated (0.19%) attributed their chemosensory dysfunction to a prior influenza vaccination. No influences of the number of lifetime influenza vaccinations on the test scores were evident in the subset of 925 patients whose dysfunction was due to other causes.",Lab tests unknown,Unknown,UNK,Unknown

Yes,"This literature marketed report as received from health professional refers to a 15 year old male patient. Patient's current condition reported as chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) and type 1 diabetes. On an unknown date, at the age of 13, the patient was presented with recurrent sinusitis and mucocutaneous fungal infections. There was no history of pneumonia or serious bacterial infections. On an unknown date, daily DIFLUCAN was given with dramatic improvement in his skin and oral candidiasis. On an unknown date, the patient was vaccinated with PCV 23 (manufacturer unspecified) injection, booster dose (dose and route of administration unspecified). On an unknown date, at the age of 15, he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with respiratory insufficiency due to pneumonia (hospitalization) complicated by pleural effusion requiring chest tube decompression. On an unknown date, the patient was discharged. On an unknown date, he was readmitted shortly after discharge for refractory pneumonia (hospitalization) and positive enterovirus PCR. On an unknown date: Autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene and quantitative immunoglobulins were normal. Polysaccharide response was poor despite repeat boosting with PCV 23 (manufacturer unspecified). On an unknown date, Tetanus and diphtheria titers were protective. Stool alpha anti-trypsin and neutrophil oxidative burst were normal. Lymphocyte enumeration was persistently abnormal and mitogen stimulation shows reduced T-cell proliferation. HIV PCR was negative. Adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase were normal. Toll-Like Receptor assay (TLR assay) showed absent toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) function but normal toll like receptor 1-8 (TLR1-8) function. Further evaluation confirmed a heterozygous L412F mutation of toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) and a heterozygous mutation in the DNA-binding domain of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT 1). Conclusion the combination of toll like receptor (TLR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) gene mutations may produce a severe form of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC).

Yes,"PNEUMOVAX23 was indicated for prevention of pneumococcal disease by the 23 serotypes contained in the vaccine. Despite its extensive use, relatively few cases of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. This literature marketed report as received from a health care professional refers to a 24 year old female patient with a history of persistent asthma, allergic rhinitis. It was assumed that patient had been vaccinated with PREVENAR previously. On an unknown date, the patient was vaccinated with PNEUMOVAX23 (dose, dose number, lot no and route of administration unknown). Concomitant therapies included Tdap. The patient had been vaccinated with both vaccines for school enrollment. One day after the immunizations she developed a 10 cm induration and erythema at the PNEUMOVAX injection site and a fever of 104.3 F, fatigue, dizziness, headache and nausea. She was admitted to the hospital for presumed erysipelas versus a vaccine allergic reaction. Relevant laboratory values on admission were leukocytosis (19,100/uL) with 86% granulocytes. There was no eosinophilia. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics for two days with improvement and was discharged on antibiotics. Two months later, an allergy clinic follow up visit revealed very high titers against Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 14- 223.0 mcg/ml; serotype 5 > 100 mcg/ml; and elevated but normal range protective titers for all other serotypes). Anti Tdap antigen titers were only moderately elevated (tetanus toxoid-5.34 IU/ml; diphtheria-2.67 IU/ml; and pertussis-12 IU/ml). Total serum IgE was elevated (317.6 IU/ml), but quantitative serum immunoglobulin levels were normal. She had a history of gelatin intolerance which caused nausea. None of the two vaccines she received contained gelatin but porcine gelatin-specific serum IgE levels were minimally elevated. It was concluded that the severe delayed systemic reaction associated with very high anti-pneumococcal antibody levels, suggested a type 3 (immune complex mediated) hypersensitivity (hospitalization). Highest antibody titers after the PNEUMOVAX were against two serotypes (5 and 14) that were contained in the 13 serotype PREVENAR. The outcome of Type 3 immune complex mediated reaction was reported as recovering. The event Type 3 immune complex mediated reaction was reported to be related to the suspect product. This case suggested that caution should be used when immunizing younger individuals with PNEUMOVAX, especially if they have previously been immunized with PREVENAR.

Concomitant therapies were not reported. On an unknown date the patient experienced blotchy skin rash. There was no associated shortness of breath or wheeze. The reporter opted not to perform skin testing due to the mild nature of the reaction and the desire to avoid excessive skin tests in this very young patient. The patient was administered the vaccine antigens individually, each at the next recommended dosing interval, in challenge doses. The reporter selected alternative preparations to administer based on subsequent reactions and components of the individual vaccines, using the CDC's Vaccine Excipient and Media Summary which lists all components of commercially available vaccines. Haemophilus b antigen was determined to be the causative agent. Conclusions: Identifying the causative agent in a patient with a vaccine reaction is critical to minimize the change of reaction recurrence which, if IgE-mediated, could be life-threatening upon reexposure. Concurrently, the necessity of immunization cannot be overstated. Many reactions are often attributed to vaccine excipients. In this case, careful evaluation demonstrated that the rash was in response to the hemophilus b antigen itself. The outcome of blotchy skin rash was reported as recovered after 20 minutes without treatment. The reporter considered blotchy skin rash to be related to PEDVAXHIB.

He is currently caught up on all his vaccinations. On October 7, 2013, Dr's office gave patient his first GARDASIL shot. He got the shot in his right (Delt) shoulder area. After the shot he did have arm soreness and redness over the next few days. I called the Drs office and they said that was normal. Over the next few weeks the soreness was still there, then on October 28, 2013 his right arm was locked and he could not move it up over his shoulder. Some of his symptoms were the soreness, popping of the shoulder, and him not able to have full range of motion. Then I just called Dr. Went to see him on November 1, 2013 and he had a x-ray done. Then on November 8, 2013 we had a MRI done, and then on November 12, 2013 we went back to Dr, and patient's test results. Dr said he has no shoulder, it is bone on bone. Not saying the shot cause it but, all of patient's doctors that I spoke to seemed concerned as am I. It even happened again on the 2nd shot of GARDASIL. Patient's second shot of GARDASIL was given on December 19, 2013 at Dr office. His second shot was given on his left (Delt) shoulder area. Then exactly 3 weeks after his shot was given, on January 9, 2014, he started getting the same symptoms. His shoulder was popping but was still able to use it. I called Dr office and they wanted to see him. On January 16, 2014 went back to see Dr and he did another x-ray and it showed exactly was the other x-ray showed on his other shoulder. So this is why I'am so concerned and reporting these to you. Not sure if the shots caused these but it seems so coincidental that it happened again. The timing between when he got each shot and when he had problems, then saw the doctors are 3-4 weeks. All the doctors that I spoke to about this agreed that this all seemed so coincidental and I should report these to the FDA.

Yes,"Very painful at time of injection and I commented to my dad very high on shoulder and painful. Unusual pain for wks got some better with ADVIL - but pain continued. I endured it for months but will not heal. I went to my family doc. and later to therapy - I'm currently on 2nd rehab trip. First I experienced pain at the time of the injection, which I have never experienced before and I also noticed how high the shot was given in my shoulder. I have experienced some soreness after previous flu shots but it usually lasts a short period of time. This time my shoulder was very sore and it hurt to raise my arm so I started taking ADVIL and it would get some better until I use it and then it will get worse for weeks. After months of this cycle I visited my family doctor I told him I did not know how I hurt my shoulder I mentioned I had a flu shot in that arm and he dismissed that thought and I agreed that sounded odd. He did a standard x-ray and said the thought I had fluid issues related to my bursa and bursitis. He prescribed CELEBREX which I took for a while but it bothers my stomach so I stopped taking it. He also later agreed that physical therapy may help so I completed my first session and saw some improvement. So now I am going to my second session with little improvement. Looking back I am sure my problem is related to my flu shot and I fear I will need surgery and not be able to work for an extended period of time. I went to the pharmacy by my home where I received the shot to make this report and the nurse said she had never filled out an Adverse Reaction Form and she called her supervisor in my presence and they agreed to call me but as of today they have not.",,None,None,Codeine causes nausea

Yes,"This VAERS report is being sent because of parental concern with a seizure disorder. Patient's mother asked me on 3 February 2014 as to whether the patient's newly diagnosed seizure disorder from October 2013 might be related to receiving the HPV vaccines (her mother had been reading the Internet). A review of history of the patient's seizures and fainting has shown that her first fainting episode occurred in 2009 (before any HPV vaccines) and was felt to be related to her menstrual cycle. She has had at least 2 other fainting episodes reported by other family members but we do not have any specific dates for those. In October of 2013 she had a syncopal episode that is thought to have possibly have been postictal since she was not seen to actually seize. She has had many seizures since that time that were finally controlled with medication by November the 14, 2013. The patient received 3 HPV vaccines in 2010 and then got 2 extra HPV vaccines in 2013. She had no reactions to the HPV vaccines at the time they were given here at the Clinic, and there is no record of difficulty with the first 3 she was given in 2010 at the previous medical facility. The patient's seizure disorder started on October 7, 2013, which was roughly 4 months after her 4th GARDASIL immunization. When she got to the Clinic her immunizations were entered into the EHR. However, the second and third HPV immunizations were not seen on our regular immunization sheet, which made it look like she had only received 1 HPV vaccine. She therefore received a second HPV vaccination on June 12, 2013, and a third one on December 20, 2013. The meningococcal immunization that was recorded in the Clinic chart was entered as having been given on April 2, 2007 (instead of April 2, 2010). She was given a second meningitis vaccine on June 12, 2013 (most likely because the date of April 2, 2007 would have been given before she was 11 and so therefore would have possibly been considered an incorrectly given dose). The following is a chronological list (as best we have) for the evolution of this seizure disorder. October 7, 2013: The patient was at volleyball practice in the afternoon. After about 5 minutes she was coughing and had some difficulty breathing so she went to the locker room. She passed out in the locker room and was found 5 minutes later. She was in and out of consciousness for about 20 minutes and was transported by EMS to hospital. At that time it was considered a syncopal episode. EKG and head CT were reported to be negative. October 8, 2013: I saw the patient in the office and she was having more coughing. I thought she had bronchitis and gave her some ZITHROMAX and a PROAIR inhaler. I arranged for a neurology appointment. October 11, 2013: Neurology appointment with Dr. At this time it was still considered syncopal although he was also concerned that this was going to be a seizure disorder. An EEG was then scheduled at that time for 21 October 2013. October 20, 2013: The patient had 2 seizures that were witnessed by her mother. An EEG was scheduled for the 21st. Her menstrual period started on 19 October 2013. Her mother had wanted a second opinion for neurology. Her tests that had been reported to be normal within the next 2 weeks included a CT scan, a Holter monitor, and an EEG. She was started on KEPPRA. October 26, 2013: She had at least 1 seizure. October 29, 2013: She had a series of 3 seizures at school. November 2, 2013: In the evening she had been unresponsive with some eye twitching and clonic movements that lasted about 3 minutes. In between times, she would seem confused but would say she was ""okay."" There was one time when she had come in having urinary incontinence and temporary ""lockjaw."" November 4, 2013: The patient was seen at Hospital. I believe that was through the emergency room. I do not know if she did make an appointment later that week.

Yes,"This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist communicated to a Pfizer Sales representative. This registered pharmacist reported for a female patient (Pharmacists great granddaughter). This Pfizer sales representative was contacted by a former Wyeth colleague (Pharmacist) on Sunday 23Feb2014 at approximately 7:00 PM ET. After some general conversation, he shared that his great granddaughter has experienced health concerns following vaccine administration. On 19Feb2014 the patient saw her pediatrician for a routine 15 month check, including three vaccination at 11am. He was not sure if the vaccines administered included PREVNAR 13. That evening about 8 pm, during normal activities, the patient became ill, she vomited and went limp and had a seizure. She kept seizing for almost a whole hour off and on. ATIVAN, phenobarbital, VERSED and other drugs were administered until she finally stopped seizing. The patient was taken to the hospital. The patient was intubated and sedated with propofol. CT scan of brain, spinal tap and EEG were performed. EEG monitor shows increased activity when her belongings talk to her. The patient had temp so it was probably a spike in temp from the vaccines but other tests were performed and flu, brain tumor, blood cancers (from cell study), stroke and meningitis were ruled out. Neurologist examined her and in his opinion the patient had a febrile seizure that went into status epilepticus, that she just kept seizing. The neurologist said that the patient EEG showed normal sedated brain waves but he wanted to see it as she woke up. Ultrasound of the abdomen to check liver and spleen were performed just to be extra cautious because the white blood cell count numbers were low. Propofol was changed to midazolam hydrochloride, fentanyl and PRECEDEX. Temp 100.4. Test results on 18Nov2013 were: WBC 8.4, Hgb 12.3, Hct 37.9, Rbc 4.15, LY 58.9, Mo 2.8, Gr 38.3, LY #4.9, Mo # 0.2, Gr # 3.2, Mcv 91.3, Mch 29.7, Mchc 32.5, Rdw 11.7, Platelets 240, Mpv 7.0. On 20Feb2014: WBC 1.5, Hgb 7.7, Platelets 128. MRI completely normal. All these low red and white cell and platelet counts sound like she had a generalized depression of bone marrow function. On 21Feb2014: Hgb 7.7 and white count 1.4. One of the doctors were equating the seizure with a fever caused by the vaccine, but the others said the patient had a viral process that caused a spike in fever, then the seizure. The patient had a couple of breathing problems with mucus clogging the airtube and having to reintubate her, and when they do that, they basically start the process all over again of having her on a lot of oxygen and sedation, then weaning her off. On 22Feb2014 at 01:00 propofol and dexmedetomidine hydrochloride were discontinued and the patient woke up in 20 - 30 minutes. Then the ventilation was took out and just oxygen nasal cannula was maintained. The patient was agitated so a mild sedation was administered. The MRI showed some swelling in the mastoid bone behind the ear and in the ethmoid sinuses. The doctors told that the overall consensus was that she was starting a viral illness, the she got the vaccines and had a reaction to that, which caused a spike in fever, which caused the seizure, and all these things caused bone marrow suppression (the white and red cell count and platelets dropping). The physician was concerned about the red blood cell count (Hgb) specifically and this needed to be followed up on since her Hgb was 12.3 in November. No pneumonia was detected. In the night between 22feb2014 and 23Feb2014 the patient had just periods of discomfort and lots of sleep. The patient remained at the hospital through Sunday 23Feb2014. The patient is reported to have low hemoglobin counts and was given a transfusion on 23Feb2014 and was treated with albuterol because she was wheezing. The patient may be transferred to another hospital.","Cell study (Feb2014): Blood cancers ruled out; EEG (8Feb2014): increased activity when her belongings talk to her, normal sedated brain waves; White blood cell count numbers (Feb2014): Low; MRI (22Feb2014): some swelling in the mastoid bone behind the ear and in the ethmoid sinuses; White cell count (22Feb2014): Drop; Red cell count (22Feb2014): Drop; Platelets (22Feb2014): Drop; 02/2014, Body temperature, spike in temp; 02/20/2014, Body temperature, 100.4; 02/21/2014, Body temperature, 100.4; 02/2014, Computerised tomogram; 11/18/2013, Granulocyte count, 3.2; 11/18/2013, Granulocytes percentage, 38.3; 11/18/2013, Haematocrit, 37.9; 11/18/2013, Haemoglobin, 12.3; 02/20/2014, Haemoglobin, 7.7; 02/21/2014, Haemoglobin, 7.7; 02/2014, Lumbar pu",No other medications,Unknown,

Yes,"Case number PHHO2014US000484, is an initial report received on 03 Jan 2014 from clinical study. This 06 year old female subject was enrolled in a study. The child's medical history included asthma and concomitant medications included Albuterol and Budesonide. It was unknown if the child had any history of viral infection or other infections. The child's family history was unknown. The child received the first dose of study vaccination on 30 Nov 2012 at 12:15 hrs. On 29 Jan 2013 at 16:42hrs, the child received second dose of study vaccination. According to the mother the child experienced easy bruising at unspecified dates prior to Apr 2013. Due to mother's concern, the subject was brought to hospital on 04 Apr 2013. According to mother child's history also included clinical signs of bilateral facial bruising with ecchymosis, and scleral hemorrhage (left) on 10 Nov 2012 following a bike accident. On 12 Apr 2013, the subject had another fall from her bike and experienced second episode of bruising which resulted in the examination at hospital emergency room on the same day. On 12 Apr 2013, platelet count was reported to be 17 K/UL. The child was referred to hematologist for further follow-up and bone marrow biopsy. The child was started on Dexamethasone 20 mg BID monthly for 5 days. Diagnostic intervention began following this incident. On 20 Feb 2014, follow-up information was received from a new investigator who did not see the child during initial visit. On an unspecified date in May 2013, the subject experienced an episode of bruising. It was reported that the child's platelet count on 07 May 2013 was low at 15 K/UL. Marrow biopsy on 13 May 2013 revealed typical but mild megakaryocyte hyperplasia without other cellular precursor abnormality noted as a finding that may be seen in ""immune thrombocytopenia"". There was no myelodysplasia. A second marrow biopsy on 17 Jul 2013, suggested ""possibility"" of immune thrombocytopenia with platelet count at 25 (units not specified). However the investigator confirmed the final diagnosis as thrombocytopenia with cause unknown (idiopathic thrombocytopenia). Bone marrow biopsy also showed no evidence of involvement by acute leukemia or marrow failure, pan-cellular. As per the records of Nov 2013, there was evidence of improvement while on steroid therapy and the last recorded platelet count was 165 (low normal range, units unspecified). There was no significant follow-up information received beyond Nov 2013, despite multiple efforts to contact the mother. The subject's outcome as of Nov 2013 was condition improving. The investigator considered the event as serious (medically significant). As per the investigator it is possible that a pre-existing condition of possible immune association could be exacerbated by the 2nd injection and immune thrombocytopenia is just a possibility and says the event is ""idiopathic thrombocytopenia"". The investigator stated that the causal relationship between the event and study vaccination was unknown, as the clinical history suggested a pre-study disorder but diagnostic confirmation was post-study and the insufficient information from the mother regarding the progression of disease contributes to this uncertainty. Follow up received on 29 Jan 2014: Updated medical history, concomitant medications, laboratory value and treatment medication. Follow up received on 04 Feb 2014: Updated the event term, medical history, seriousness, event outcome and treatment.

He reported that he did feel last night with alternating chills, but did not experience any difficulty breathing or swallowing. He also denied any traumatic events this past weekend that might have been responsible for the swelling of the left side of his face. The man believed he knew what was occurring and reported that he had a history of submandibular abscesses, with two in recent years requiring treatment with incision and drainage and intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. He showed you a faint scar in his left submandibular region. At this point the patient was guide into the clinic room, place him on the exam table, and obtain vital signs, which were pertinent for an oral temperature of 100.4 degrees (38 degrees) and heart rate of 105. A thorough evaluation of his ears, nose, mouth, and throat produced no abnormal findings.Palpation of his left submandibular and preauricular region confirmed increased swelling when compared to the right side of his face. The patient also reported tenderness with palpation of the left side of his face. The patient was an otherwise healthy 25-year-old man with no pertinent medical or surgical history and he was properly medically out-processed. On an unspecified date, the patient was vaccinated with a dose of M-M-R II (dose, route and lot number not reported). The next day, on an unknown date, the patient returned and presented with worsening neck pain and increased firmness of the left-sided swelling. He reported continuing fevers and chills through the night and overall worse. Fortunately, the facility had a visiting host-nation otolaryngologist who agreed to consult on the patient. He agreed that this was a worsening submandibular abscess and admitted the patient to the hospital for intravenous therapy broad spectrum antibiotics and observation. The patient denied testicular involvement. He continued to experience intermittent fevers and headaches and was having difficulty tolerating a regular diet. After discussion with the hospitalist, the patient continued inpatient care with isolation, provided supportive care but discontinued his IV antibiotics as his clinical presentation was consistent with mumps and IV antibiotics would provide no benefit for treatment.

His most recent physical exam was unremarkable for parotitis. He could return to work. The M-M-R II vaccine has been shown to have 96% protective efficacy. Therefore, about 4% of people who has been vaccinated can still acquire a mumps infection.

A little bit after taking off I began to feel a little bit lethargic, and a short time after that a little bit weak.  As time went on my body started to hurt slightly, as if I were getting the flu.  A few hours into our flight we began refueling.  Shortly after starting our refueling activities I felt a sense of having the flu.  My bones or muscles were extremely achy, though I felt a greater amount of pain in all of my joints.  Fortunately we only did drogue refueling, which required no technical inputs from me that would affect any flight characteristics of either the aircraft I was in, or any of the receivers.  At the time the pain and discomfort was mild.  Shortly after our scheduled refueling had reached its conclusion, and I sat down again and rested.  I felt nauseous and extreme pain throughout my muscles and joints, as well as having a headache.  It became difficult to concentrate and focus on conversations. When the beginning symptoms set on I thought I was reacting to food poisoning.  I have experiences food poisoning which had led to similar symptoms of nausea and joint aching, but then I had realized it had been over 6 hours since I had eaten, and I have never had such a delayed reaction.  Once I had been experiencing the body aching along with cold sweats I recalled that during my first Typhoid immunization injection in 1992 I had an identical reaction, albeit far more severe during the 1st immunization.  During the 1st immunization the body aching was so severe it hurt to move anything.  Everything hurt except to lay still in my bed, and then the pain was limited to throbbing joints.

Yes,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of babesiosis in a 35-day-old male subject who was vaccinated with Hepatitis B vaccine (manufacturer unspecified). The subject lived with his parents, his twin and an older sibling in a suburban, forested neighbourhood where the mother frequently walked. The parents had gone on holidays to an island approximately 2.5 months before the event. They had been out of the country years earlier too, which had been their only international travel. The parents reported that they had had upper respiratory tract symptoms recently. The family had a pet dog. The subject had been born by caesarean section due to fraternal twin pregnancy and breech presentation at 37.5 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy had been uncomplicated and his mother had received prenatal care that included prenatal screening tests for gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis, group B streptococcus, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus. The results for all of them had been negative. Her rubella immunity screening test had been positive. Prior to the delivery there had been no prolonged rupture of membranes (ruptured less than 24 hours before delivery) and antibiotic drugs had been administered. Apgars results were 9 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. He had received an unspecified hepatitis B vaccine before been discharged from hospital. He was mixed fed (breast milk and formula). On an unspecified date, during the routine 1-month examination at the pediatrician which was done 2 days before admission, the subject received 2nd dose of Hepatitis B vaccine (unknown route of administration and batch number). One day after vaccination with Hepatitis B vaccine, the subject's mother noticed an increased fussiness, pale and warm skin and one episode of vomiting. On the next day, the subject was taken to his pediatrician with a complaint of fever, vomiting, mottled skin and severe anaemia. Tachycardia was noted and the vomiting had increased. On examination at the paediatrician's office, the subject was pale with mottled skin and his temperature was 38.6?C. He was referred immediately to the emergency department of an hospital. On clinical examination at the emergency department, his weight was 3.61 kg, rectal temperature 38.0?C, blood pressure 113-63 mm Hg, pulse 172 beats per minute, respiratory rate 64 breaths per minute and his oxygen saturation 97% on air. The subject was pale, listless and fussy, with mild suprasternal and intercostal retractions but without grunting, nasal flaring, apnoeic episodes or desaturation events. He had a brisk capillary refill. He responded vigorously during the evaluation for sepsis, although he quickly feel asleep when not bothered. The rest of the examination was normal. Samples of the blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for different tests and culture. His ABO type was O, Rh positive and the antibody screening was negative. Serum renal function test, electrolytes levels, glucose, calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal. Haematocrit level was 16.9%, haemoglobin was 6.1 g/dl, platelet count was 23,000 per mm3 and neutrophil level was 6%. The rest of the full blood count results were within normal range. The urine sample was dark red and cloudy. On dipstick urine analysis the pH was 7.0, the specific gravity 1.015, there was a large amount of blood, 100 mg/dl of protein and traces of leukocyte esterase. Urine analysis also revealed 0 to 5 red cells and white cells per high-power field and a small amount of bacteria, a moderate number of epithelial cells and 15 to 20 granular casts per low-power field. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed that 35 to 40% of the erythrocytes contained multiple ring forms.

This pain became more intense and started to happen more frequently. I saw the dr on October 28th, a retina specialist. He advised me to see my family doctor. I saw dr on October 30th and he diagnosed me with trigeminal neuralgia, he put me on carbamazepine twice a day. The medication did not help the pain. I had an MRI on November 11th and a CT scan on November 14th. Both of these tests came back normal. Dr increased my medication on November 25th to three pills a day. The medication still was not helping the pain so I sought other options. I saw dr who is a DC on December 11 and January 6th, 2014. On January 7th 2014 dr prescribed four pills a day because the three pills were not sufficiently stopping the debilitating pain in my right eye. On February 28 I dr who is a neurologist and he confirmed the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, he suggested I have a gamma knife procedure because six months is a very long time to have trigeminal neuralgia consistently. I wanted another opinion so I went to dr on March 13th, she confirmed trigeminal neuralgia and it was caused by the flu vaccination.

The subject was born at 39 weeks of gestation by caesarean section due to prolonged labour following an uncomplicated pregnancy. There was no reported history of febrile illness or trauma and a photography from day 1 of life showed normal eye abduction. A maternal uncle had a history of strabismus. No further information on his medical, family history or concurrent medication was available. On an unspecified date, at 2-day of life, the subject received 1st dose of ENGERIX B (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided). 2 days after vaccination with ENGERIX B, the subject experienced partial paralysis of abducent nerve and esotropia. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. On ophthalmological examination, he showed marked limitation of abduction in the right eye (-3) and full ductions in the left eye. This was consistent with right lateral rectus paralysis. He blinked to light with each eye. Dilated fundus examination was normal. His paediatrician performed a neurological examination that was notable only for the abducens nerve palsy. MRI of the brain and orbits, with and without contrast, was performed and T1- and T2-weighted fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted images with fat suppression revealed no abnormalities. Diagnosis was isolated abducens nerve palsy. The treatment consisted of part-time occlusion therapy of his left eye. Examination on day 30 of life revealed a 60 degree right esotropia in primary gaze at near. Cycloplegic refraction revealed +13.25 D spherical error for each eye. He maintained fixation in adduction in the right eye and had central, steady, and maintained fixation in his left eye. At 2 months of age the esotropia had resolved and he was orthotropic in primary gaze, with full abduction of the right eye. Patching was discontinued at this visit. Examinations at 4, 12, and 18 months of age revealed orthotropia in primary gaze, with no limitation of abduction of the right eye. His vision was 9.8 cycles per degree (20/60, within normal range) in each eye using teller acuity cards at the 18-month of age follow-up examination. The author's conclusion stated that they believed that his sixth nerve palsy was caused by the vaccination, although other, less likely, possibilities include cryptogenic or unreported trauma. Presumed postimmunization abducens nerve palsy typically resolves spontaneously within 6 months, although it was often associated with a recurrence.","Neurological examination, abducens nerve p; Nuclear magnetic resonance ima, normal; Ophthalmological examination, limitation of ab",,Unknown,

I had a persistent strong headache that lasted the whole week, my vision became painful when I tried to read anything, mild fever, mild bruising, pain, redness/sunburn-like skin of my right foot, numbness, swelling of my right foot and ankles and legs, right foot had gone through some muscle weakness, my right foot-my skin became dry, rough, leathery, and weighed extra heavy while bottom of foot sagged from it's extra weight. My right lower leg and ankle is bent, crooked (moved to one side), and out of joint. I can't walk without assistance (a walker). I experience fatigue, sleep more, lack strength which limits the amount of work that I can do each day. On some days, my feet are very sensitive to any floor surface that I walk on so I may end up taking TYLENOL or aspirin for pain. Frequently, I skip meals because it's too painful/difficult to walk. The pain is not primarily coming from a tingling foot. Mostly, when I's sitting or standing, my right foot will not lay flat on the floor. My arch to my heel wants to stand off the ground. Sometimes, my upper left leg and hip will start hurting because of how much the left side of my body has to support the rest of me.

I started taking a few short steps passing two lazy boy chairs and near the second chair my right ankle gave way two times within five minutes causing me to slide onto the floor along side the chair and then I had a hard time getting into the chair.

I would not be able to fall asleep at night because it felt like if I wasn't awake to think to breathe I would stop breathing.  My heart would also feel like it was fluttering or beating weird.  I went to several doctors through out these 10 weeks because none seemed to take me seriously or really be knowledgeable about what this could be.  I was so weak and didn't have energy to do much.  I had to stop working and only worked one hour every 30 days in order to keep my job.  It was all I could do to go to school and come home.  I have always enjoyed exercise and still have not exercised in over 10 weeks now.  Between weeks 3-6 it got very hard to walk.  I would notice myself using my hands to stand up out of a chair.

This report refers to a 38-year-old female patient. She was a mother to two children aged 5 and 3 years old. Her medical history included allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with sensitization to tree, grass, dust mite, cat, alternaria species and perennial mold in addition to well controlled asthma. She managed with 2 puffs of 40 mg of beclomethasone inhaled twice daily, 2 nasal squirts of 50 mg of fluticasone propionate daily and intermittent use of over-the-counter ketotifen ocular drops as needed. She used her Albuterol inhaler before exercise and intermittently (no more than once per week). It was reported that the previous few years, she averaged approximately 4 exacerbations per year and all required oral corticosteroid courses. The patient was vaccinated with influenza vaccine (manufacturer and batch number: not reported, so conservatively coded as influenza vaccine INN (seasonal or pandemic)) on an unknown dates in the past 2 years. On an unknown date, the patient contracted influenza and had an asthma exacerbation causing her to miss a day of work despite receiving the vaccine. She reported past asthma flared up within a month of vaccination, which in part has motivated her decision to defer influenza vaccination for some years. She expressed that she does not want to get sick from the vaccine and that some years she felt the vaccine does not work. The author concluded that influenza vaccine itself was linked to causing any asthma flares or contraction of influenza virus but it need to be discussed that vaccination might not prevent influenza-related asthma complications. In past years, the main circulating strain of influenza B has not been in the vaccine, validating the patient's concern that vaccine efficacy might not be optimal in some years. However, vaccination is still the best recommendation to prevent her from contracting influenza and highlight that new quadrivalent vaccines are available that will hopefully provide more robust coverage against circulating influenza strains. It was reported that the patient was re-vaccinated with influenza vaccine (manufacturer and batch number: not reported) on an unknown date and this time she was without any issue and neither had any asthma-related complications during the influenza season.",,Beclomethasone; Fluticasone propionate; Ketotifen; Albuterol; Corticosteroids,"Conjunctivitis allergic with sensitization to tree, grass, dust mite, cat, alternaria species and perennial mold; Asthma",

Eyes were open, arms and legs were seizing and baby started to foam at mouth.  Paramedics were called.  Oxygen was administered.  Seizure lasted approximately 5-6 minutes.  Baby's temperature was 101.5 degrees when checked in the ambulance but paramedics said it was probably more like 103-104 during the seizure. In hospital, motrin and tylenol were administered. Blood was drawn to check for abnormalities and nothing was found.  Baby did not return to normal self in terms of behavior for several hours (4 hrs). Sent home from hospital after 6 hours total and continued to give motrin and tylenol for the next 24 hours.

No information has been provided on the subject's medical, family history or concurrent medication. A 4-month-old male subject was taken to a community hospital with a 2-day history of irritability, vomiting and dark stools shortly after receiving his 4-month immunisations including DTPa, Hib, rotavirus, pneumococcal conjugate and IPOL on an unspecified date (manufacturers, batch numbers, doses and injection sites unknown). No information has been provided on the clinical examination performed on the subject. Blood analysis revealed initial haemoglobin of 2.7 g/dL so he was transferred to an academic centre. Once there he had a weakly positive direct antiglobulin test with negative complement component 3 and immunoglobulin G. Further testing revealed immunoglobulin A mediated autoantibodies. Diagnosis was autoimmune vaccine-related haemolytic anaemia based on these results. Treatment consisted of oral corticosteroids. Outcome is improvement in his haemoglobin levels after treatment. The 6-month immunisations were given using a staggered approach that included serial full blood counts following each individual vaccine to monitor for evidence of haemolysis. Both IPOL and DTPa vaccines were given without incident; but his haemoglobin dropped to 7.0 g/dL and haemolysis was noted after the administration of the Hib vaccine. According to the authors this suggests that this vaccine was responsible for the initial episode so they plan to give him further Hib vaccine doses with steroid pre-treatment in the future. Author's conclusion: ""We believe this case illustrates a novel method for not only confirming immunization associated AIHA but also isolating the causative vaccination"".","Antiglobulin test direct, positive; Hemoglobin, 2.7g/dL; Hemoglobin, 7.0g/dL; Immunoglobulin G, negative",,Unknown,

Yes,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of bacterial meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae type E (Hie) in a 9-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with Hib vaccine (manufacturer unspecified). Historic vaccination included Hib vaccine; given at 2, 4, 6 month of age (manufacturers, batch numbers, doses and injection sites unknown). The authors report that the subject was healthy before the event. Investigations performed during the event confirmed that the subject and her younger sibling were up to date with their immunisations, including the Hib conjugate vaccine. No further information on her medical, family history or concurrent medication was available. When she was 12 month old, the subject received 4th dose of Hib vaccine (unknown route and injection site, lot number not provided). On 24 October 2011, 8 years after vaccination with Hib vaccine, the subject presented to a paediatric office with a 2-week history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, including a non-productive cough and negative strep throat culture, fever up to 39.4 Deg. C, headache, stiff neck, irritability but no rash. The presumed diagnosis at the time was bacterial meningitis. The subject was treated initially with a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) and she was transferred to a local emergency department where a head computed tomography scan with contrast performed suggested acute or chronic pansinusitis; the subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast also demonstrated pansinusitis with no evidence of intracranial abscess or tracking from the sinuses. Based on these finding the differential diagnosis at the time was bacterial meningitis due to invasive H. influenzae and/or meningococcal disease. The subject was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone, GENTAMYCIN and vancomycin. No steroids were administered in view of the unclear gram stain results and low suspicion for Hib meningitis. The subject was hospitalised to the paediatric intensive care unit. Since meningococcal disease could not be ruled out, the local health department was contacted to initiate an investigation. On 26 October 2011, the subject's condition had improved significantly so she was transferred to a regular paediatric ward. Her antibiotic regimen was switched to ceftriaxone alone at that time as the initial negative cerebrospinal fluid culture following only a single dose of ceftriaxone suggested that the organism was susceptible to that antibiotic. Staff from the regional department of public health interviewed the subject's mother at this point to determine any potential exposure and the need for post exposure prophylaxis for bacterial meningitis due to invasive Haemophilus influenzae and/or meningococcal disease. The subject's family received prescriptions for post exposure prophylaxis; ciprofloxacin for the parents and rifampin for the younger sibling. On 27 October 2011, Haemophilus influenzae type E was identified from the subject's cerebrospinal fluid culture. The final diagnosis was bacterial meningitis due to invasive Haemophilus influenzae type E. On 30 October 2011, the subject was discharged home due to her recovery. On 02 November 2011, during a follow up with her paediatrician, the subject still had some mild headaches, but she had no neurological deficits and was doing well. Author's conclusion: ""For the post-Hib conjugated vaccine era, we are not aware of any other published cases of meningitis due to Hie among previously healthy school-aged children in this country; however, agency reported Hie meningitis amongst two previously healthy children in two other countries.""","Body temperature, 24Oct2011, 39.4 Deg.
